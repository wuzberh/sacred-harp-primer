# Lesson 1: The Major Scale and the Four Basic Shapes

## Introduction

Welcome to your first lesson in Sacred Harp sight‑singing! This lesson introduces the fundamental building blocks of the Sacred Harp notation system: the four shape notes and the *fa‑sol‑la‑fa‑sol‑la‑mi* scale. By the end of this lesson you will be able to recognize the shapes on the printed page and sing the scale using the correct solfege syllables.

## What is Relative Pitch?

Before we look at the shapes, it’s important to understand the idea of **relative pitch**. In Sacred Harp singing we don’t worry about fixed notes (like “C” or “G”). Instead, we learn to hear the *distance* between one note and the next. The shapes tell us how far to move our voice up or down, not what exact pitch to sing. This means a song can be started on any comfortable pitch—the relationships among the notes stay the same.

## The Four Shape Notes

Sacred Harp uses four distinct shapes to represent the seven notes of the major scale. Each shape is tied to a solfege syllable:

| Shape | Name | Solfege Syllable | ASCII Approximation |
|-------|------|------------------|---------------------|
| ▲     | Fa   | **Fa**           | Triangle            |
| ○     | Sol  | **Sol**          | Oval                |
| ▭     | La   | **La**           | Rectangle           |
| ◇     | Mi   | **Mi**           | Diamond             |

In the printed book the shapes are drawn clearly, but for now you can memorize the association: **Fa** = triangle, **Sol** = oval, **La** = rectangle, **Mi** = diamond.

## The Fa‑Sol‑La‑Fa‑Sol‑La‑Mi Scale

The major scale in Sacred Harp is sung with the syllables **Fa, Sol, La, Fa, Sol, La, Mi, (Fa)**. Notice that the first three notes (Fa‑Sol‑La) repeat for the next three notes, and the seventh note is Mi. This pattern corresponds to the familiar “do‑re‑mi‑fa‑sol‑la‑ti‑do” scale, but with the Sacred Harp solfege.

Try singing the scale slowly, starting on any comfortable pitch:

> **Fa** – **Sol** – **La** – **Fa** – **Sol** – **La** – **Mi** – **Fa**

Practice moving up and down this scale until the intervals feel natural.

## Seeing the Shapes in a Real Tune: “New Britain” (AMAZING GRACE)

To put everything together, let’s look at the opening phrase of one of the most well‑known Sacred Harp tunes, **“New Britain”** (often sung to the words “Amazing Grace”).

Below is the melody written out with shape‑note symbols and the corresponding solfege syllables. (The actual Sacred Harp notation uses a four‑line staff; here we show the shape names above the lyrics as a learning aid.)

```
Shapes:  La   Sol   Fa   Mi   La   Sol   Fa   Mi   La
Syllables: La   Sol   Fa   Mi   La   Sol   Fa   Mi   La
Lyrics:   A‑   ‑maz‑ ing   grace!   How   sweet   the   sound
```

*Explanation*: The first note is a **La** (rectangle), the second is **Sol** (oval), the third is **Fa** (triangle), the fourth is **Mi** (diamond), and the pattern repeats. Sing the phrase using the syllables, then try it with the words.

## Practice Exercise

1. **Scale practice**: Sing the fa‑sol‑la‑fa‑sol‑la‑mi‑fa scale five times, starting on a different pitch each time.
2. **Shape recognition**: Open The Sacred Harp (1991 Denson edition) to any page and point out every Fa, Sol, La, and Mi shape you see.
3. **Melody practice**: Sing the “New Britain” phrase with the solfege syllables until you can do it without looking at the page.

## Summary

- Relative pitch lets us sing the same song at any starting pitch.
- The four shapes are **Fa** (triangle), **Sol** (oval), **La** (rectangle), and **Mi** (diamond).
- The Sacred Harp scale is sung **Fa‑Sol‑La‑Fa‑Sol‑La‑Mi‑Fa**.
- You can now recognize these shapes in a real Sacred Harp tune and sing them with the correct syllables.

In the next lesson we’ll learn how the shapes are placed on the staff and how to read simple melodies.
