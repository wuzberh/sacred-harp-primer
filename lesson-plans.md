# Lesson Plans Roadmap

This document outlines the planned lessons for the Sacred Harp Primer. Each lesson corresponds to a GitHub Issue (to be created). The issues will track development and discussion.

## Lesson 1: The Major Scale and the Four Basic Shapes (Fa, Sol, La, Mi)

**Status:** Completed (see `lesson-01-scale-and-shapes.md`)

**Key Concepts:**
- Relative pitch
- Four shape notes: Fa (triangle), Sol (oval), La (rectangle), Mi (diamond)
- Fa‑sol‑la‑fa‑sol‑la‑mi scale
- Shape recognition in a printed tunebook

**Learning Goal:** Sing the scale on pitch and identify the four shapes on a page.

## Lesson 2: Reading Simple Melodies on the Staff

**Key Concepts:**
- The four‑line staff used in The Sacred Harp
- Placement of shape notes on the staff lines and spaces
- Reading step‑wise melodies (adjacent notes)
- Introduction to clefs (treble and bass) and their transposition in Sacred Harp

**Learning Goal:** Sight‑read a simple, step‑wise melody from the Sacred Harp using shape notes.

## Lesson 3: Introduction to Rhythm and Time Signatures

**Key Concepts:**
- Note values (whole, half, quarter, eighth) in shape‑note notation
- Time signatures (4/4, 3/4, 2/4) and their meaning
- Ties, rests, and dotted notes
- Clapping and counting exercises

**Learning Goal:** Clap and count the rhythm of a short Sacred Harp tune and understand how time signatures organize the music.
