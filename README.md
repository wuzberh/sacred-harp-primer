# Sacred Harp Primer

An open-access, digital primer to help untrained singers learn the basics of Sacred Harp sight-singing using shape notes.

## Purpose

This project provides a free, step-by-step guide for learning to sight-read from **The Sacred Harp (1991 Denson edition)**, aimed at those with no prior musical training. It focuses on the unique shape-note notation system and the *fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi* solfege syllable system used in Sacred Harp singing.

## What is Sacred Harp?

Sacred Harp is a traditional American form of a cappella sacred music, characterized by its distinctive four-shape notation (Fa, Sol, La, Mi) and its practice of "singing the shapes" before singing the words. This primer aims to make this rich tradition accessible to newcomers by breaking down the fundamentals of sight-singing in a clear, beginner-friendly way.

## How to Use This Primer

Each lesson will introduce a new concept, provide examples from the Sacred Harp tunebook, and offer exercises for practice. The material is designed to be self-paced and can be used individually or in a group setting.
